                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hii :) My name is Karina and I LOVE making desserts to satisfy my sweet tooth.</p>
                        <p>Here is a picture of me with the first cake I made when I was 14 years old.
                          Ever since that day, I fell in love with baking desserts, and it has been my hobby for years now.
                          I make sweets for my family, friends and of course myself. </p>
                        <p>Growing up in Ukraine, I was always surrounded by delicious baked goods that my mom and her dad, my grandfather, used to make.
                          It's safe to say that their love for baking was passed down to me. </p>
                        <p>Food brings people together, so I will be sharing my favorite dessert recipes here with you,
                          hoping that you will share the same love for sweets with your close family and friends.</p>
